/**
 * Provides centralized navigation logic for the application.
 *
 * This class wraps around the [NavHostController] to handle all navigation between the appâ€™s
 * different [Screen] destinations in a consistent and predictable way.
 *
 * It is designed to:
 * - Prevent duplicate navigations to the same top-level destination.
 * - Manage back stack behavior and state restoration.
 * - Offer reusable, extendable navigation methods for ViewModels or UI components.
 *
 * Subclass this class if you need to extend or customize navigation behavior.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val navActions = NavigationActions(navController)
 * navActions.navigateTo(NavigationDestinations.Screen.Profile)
 * ```

   * - Launches the destination in single-top mode (avoids duplicate destinations).
   * - Pops up to the root of the navigation graph while preserving state.
   * - Restores any previously saved state for that destination.
